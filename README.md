<h1>Data Structures & Algorithms Repository</h1> <p> Welcome to the <strong>Data Structures & Algorithms Repository</strong> — a comprehensive collection designed to strengthen your foundational computer science knowledge and problem-solving mindset. This repo covers essential <strong>Linear</strong> and <strong>Non-Linear</strong> data structures, along with key <strong>Sorting</strong> and <strong>Searching</strong> algorithms that every software engineer should master. </p> <h3>🚀 Repository Overview</h3> <p> Inside this repository, you'll find well-structured implementations and explanations of core topics including: </p> <ul> <li>📦 <strong>Linear Data Structures</strong> — Arrays, Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists</li> <li>🌲 <strong>Non-Linear Data Structures</strong> — Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), and AVL Trees</li> <li>⚙️ <strong>Sorting Algorithms</strong> — Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and more</li> <li>🔍 <strong>Searching Techniques</strong> — Binary Search, Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS)</li> </ul> <h3>📂 Repository Structure</h3> <ul> <li><code>Queue/</code> — Implementations and examples of queue variants (simple queue, circular queue, deque, and priority queue), enqueue/dequeue operations, common use-cases, and complexity analysis. Includes test scripts and small exercises to practice FIFO patterns.</li> <li><code>SLL/</code> — Singly Linked List implementations and utilities: node structure, insert (head/tail/at-index), delete, search, reverse, detect cycles, merge two lists, and example problems that illustrate pointer manipulation and memory reasoning.</li> <li><code>Sorting-Algorithms/</code> — Collection of sorting implementations (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quick, Heap, Counting, Radix) with annotated code, step-by-step explanations, and time/space complexity comparisons. Includes visualization helpers and sample inputs for benchmarking.</li> <li><code>Stack/</code> — LIFO stack implementations using arrays and linked lists, push/pop/peek operations, stack-based algorithm examples (parentheses matching, infix-to-postfix, expression evaluation), and problems illustrating recursion and backtracking patterns.</li> </ul> <h3>🧭 Getting Started</h3> <ul> <li>Clone or download this repository to your local machine.</li> <li>Open the folder of the topic you want to explore (e.g., <code>Sorting Algorithms</code>).</li> <li>Read the comments and theory section in each file for a deeper understanding.</li> <li>Run the code to see how each data structure or algorithm behaves in action.</li> </ul> <h3>💡 Why Explore This Repository</h3> <ul> <li>Strengthen your computer science fundamentals through practical coding examples.</li> <li>Understand not only <strong>how</strong> algorithms work, but also <strong>why</strong> they work.</li> <li>Enhance your preparation for <strong>technical interviews</strong> and <strong>competitive programming</strong>.</li> <li>Explore clean, structured, and well-documented implementations.</li> </ul> <h3>🤝 Contributions</h3> <p> Contributions are welcome! If you have optimized solutions, clearer explanations, or new topics to add — feel free to fork, enhance, and submit a pull request. Together, we can build a strong open-source learning hub for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. </p> <h3>🌟 Let’s Master Algorithms Together!</h3> <p> Start exploring, experiment with different implementations, and understand the trade-offs behind every algorithmic decision. Keep challenging yourself — the best way to learn algorithms is to <strong>build, break, and rebuild</strong>. </p> <h3>📬 Connect with Me</h3> <p> Let’s discuss, share ideas, and grow together!
